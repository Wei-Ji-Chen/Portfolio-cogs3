            <h3>My Contributions</h3>
            <p>I worked on enhancing the perception capabilities of the robot using advanced computer vision models. This involved developing and integrating machine learning algorithms that enable the robot to interpret and interact with its environment more effectively. My focus was on improving object recognition and scene understanding to facilitate smoother interactions and decision-making processes in dynamic settings.</p>

        <h2>Marvel's Spiderman üéÆ</h2>
        <p>An action-adventure single-player video game played from a third-person perspective. As with the first game and Miles Morales, 
            Peter Parker and Miles Morales are the two main characters, with Mary Jane and Venom playable in certain missions, becoming individually playable in accordance with the story as they traverse an open world New York City and fight enemies.</p>

            <h3>My Contributions</h3>
            <p>My role in the Marvel's Spiderman game was centered on enhancing the computer graphics from the Sony team. I worked on developing the visual effects and rendering techniques that brought a new level of realism to the game. This included creating realistic lighting and shadow effects, optimizing frame rates without compromising the visual fidelity, and implementing particle systems for more dynamic interactions within the game's environment.</p>

        <h2>IKEA Place üè†</h2>
        <p>IKEA announces the launch of IKEA Place, an augmented reality (AR) application that lets people confidently experience, experiment and share how good design transforms any space, such as a home, office, school, or studio. From sofas and armchairs to coffee tables, all of the products in IKEA Place are 3D and 
            true to scale so that every choice is just the right size, design, and function.</p>

            <h3>My Contributions</h3>
            <p>Following the acquisition of Geomagical by IKEA, I played a pivotal role in optimizing the computer vision models to ensure they were efficient enough to run on an iOS app. This involved refining the algorithms to reduce their computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy. I also contributed to integrating these models with the app‚Äôs AR framework, enabling real-time furniture placement and visualization in diverse settings.</p>
